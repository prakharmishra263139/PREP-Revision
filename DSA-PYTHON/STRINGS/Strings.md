## What are Strings?

- A **string** is a sequence of characters arranged in a specific order.
- Each character in a string has a specific index, starting from **0** (zero-based indexing).

**Example:**
Suppose we have this string:
```python
s = "striver"
```
The indexes for each character are:

| Index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Char  | s | t | r | i | v | e | r |

- `s[0]` → `'s'` (first character)
- `s[1]` → `'t'` (second character)
- `s[2]` → `'r'` (third character)

> Zero-based indexing is fundamental in manipulating and accessing characters in strings.
