Data Types in Python

Python is dynamically typed, so you don't need to declare data types — the interpreter determines the type at runtime. This speeds up coding, but can introduce subtle bugs if you’re not careful.

Main Python Data Types:
    - Numeric Types:
        - int:          integers (unlimited size)
        - float:        floating-point numbers (double precision)
        - complex:      complex numbers (e.g., 3+5j)
    - Sequence Types:
        - list:         ordered, mutable collections
        - tuple:        ordered, immutable collections
        - range:        immutable sequence of numbers
    - Text Type:
        - str:          strings
    - Mapping Type:
        - dict:         key-value pairs
    - Set Types:
        - set:          unordered collection of unique elements
        - frozenset:    immutable set
    - Boolean Type:
        - bool:         logical values (True or False)
        
Python is flexible you can assign an integer to a variable, then later assign a string to the same variable without errors. But this flexibility means you have to be more cautious with type-related logic.
